# SHL Assessment Recommendation System

## Overview
This project leverages **Generative AI** to build a web-based **SHL Assessment Recommendation System**. The tool aims to recommend suitable SHL assessments to users based on their profile, preferences, and requirements, providing meaningful and tailored insights for skills evaluation and development.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest SHL assessments tailored to user inputs, such as role, industry, and skill requirements.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Uses advanced AI models to craft well-informed, context-specific recommendations.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Simple, intuitive web-based interface for seamless interaction.
- **Scalable Design**: Supports large datasets and diverse user queries.

## Architecture
The system comprises:
1. **Frontend**: Built with frameworks like React.js or Angular for an interactive user interface.
2. **Backend**: Powered by Flask/FastAPI to manage user queries and connect to AI models.
3. **Database**: Stores SHL assessment catalog data in a structured format (SQL/NoSQL).
4. **Generative AI**: Integrated with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI APIs for intelligent recommendation generation.
